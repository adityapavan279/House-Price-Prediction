House Price Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the price of house. 
The real estate market has always been a fascinating field, and with the help of data science techniques, we can now make more accurate predictions about house prices.
Leveraging the Random Forest algorithm, which combines the power of multiple decision trees, we can capture complex relationships and important features that influence house prices.

The model takes into account various factors such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other significant attributes to estimate the price of a house. 
It has been trained on a comprehensive dataset, ensuring that it provides reliable predictions that align with market trends.
